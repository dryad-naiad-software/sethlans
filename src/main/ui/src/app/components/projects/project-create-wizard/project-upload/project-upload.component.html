  <h5>Project Upload</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Valid files are <strong>.blend</strong> files with packed textures, and <strong>ZIP</strong> files.
    </li>
    <li>When uploading <strong>ZIP</strong> archives:
      <ul>
        <li>Main blend file must be in root of the archive.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the <strong>ZIP</strong> file is named after the main .blend file. Ex: "Dog Cartoon.blend" in
          "Dog Cartoon.zip"
        </li>
        <li>Textures and assets must be in their own separate folders.</li>
        <li>The paths to all textures and assets must be relative. This is the default option in blender. For more
          information see <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/files/relative_paths.html">Relative
            Paths</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Only <strong>Blender Render</strong> and <strong>Cycles</strong> is
      supported.
    </li>
    <li>Set the output file to an <strong>image</strong>, for example <strong>PNG</strong>.</li>
    <li>Verify that the uploaded file has been saved in one of the blender versions present on the server:
      <ul>
        <li *ngFor="let version of projectWizard.availableBlenderVersions"><strong>{{version}}</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
